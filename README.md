# UNDER CONSTRUCTION

  Shoprocket Printer aims to be a ready to go solution for label printing and kitchen automation. The whole project is open sourced and Shoprocket will never make profit from it. This project is just a first vertion of a much smarter solution and the contributions of the community are more then welcome. 
 
 
  This repository is designed to supply everything that is necessary to get access to Shoprocket's printing solution. To get things running you will need a Raspberry pi (version 1 or 2), a Pipsta Printer, a SD card (we recomend a class 10 one) and just to configure the system you will want a Monitor (with HMDI entry), a mouse and a keyboard. For bunissess using Shoprocket's ecommerce solution on their own websites just get in touch and we will make everthing runnig for you!

Printer.Image: Images ready to go, just download one of the images flash it into a SD card. For more information just click on the Printer.Image and get everything that you need.

Resin.IO: All the information to deploy the Shoprocket's application to multiple devices and control them through a dashboard.

Server: Here are the necessary files to setup a webserver to send information directly from websites to your printer.

Next steps of this project are:

- Make it run from platforms differents from Rapberry pi.
- Replace the two plugs for a baterry rechargeble over the night.
- Add a 4G adaptor, so it is possible to comunicate with the printer through a cellphone.
- Project a 3D printed case, so people can Download the file and print the printer case wherever they are.
- Make the printer production cheaper as possible. 
- Raise people awareness of the project.
