  This repository is designed to supply everything that is necessary to get access to Shoprocket's printing solution. To get things running you will need a Raspberry pi (version 1 or 2), a Pipsta Printer, a SD card (we recomend a class 10 one) and just to configure the system you will want a Monitor (with HMDI entry), a mouse and a keyboard. For bunissess using Shoprocket's ecommerce solution on their own websites just get in touch and we will make everthing runnig for you!
